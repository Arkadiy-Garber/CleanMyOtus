This sample dataset is provided for two reasons:
first, to make sure the script is functioning properly on your system; 
second, to give you an idea of what format the files need to be given to the program

the files you should fine here are the following:
OTUseqs.fna (this file contains the representative OTU sequences in FASTA format)
OTUtable-mothur.tsv (mothur-output OTU table)
sampleToBlank.txt (tab-delimitted file of telling the program which samples correspond to which blanks).
If you have only one blank for all your samples, please still provide the sampleToBlank.txt file (it's okay that
you will have the same blank listed for each sample).
