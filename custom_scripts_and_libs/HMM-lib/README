This HMM library contains HMMs sourced from {https://github.com/banfieldlab/metabolic-hmms} and publsihed alongside 
Anantharaman et al (2016). These HMMs were calibrated and designated bitscore cutoffs (included in hmm-meta.txt) utilized
in the hmm-metabolisms.py algorithm. In addition, this HMM library contains HMMs that I designed and calibrated myself.
